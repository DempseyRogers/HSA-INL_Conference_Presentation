\begin{frame}{Optimize POF$(\vec{m})$}
    Assumption: Anomalous data has a fragile relationship with background data. This relationship will not minimize the POF as well as common points. \vfill

    \textbf{HSI Pipeline:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A set of "evolved" matrices are kept $\vec{A}^k$
        \item Anomaly scores, $\vec{m}$, are used to minimize POF 
        \item Minimized anomaly scores are used as starting point for POF at $k+1$
        \item Once anomaly score converge with in a tolerance, optimization ends
        \item $\abs Z_{score}\abs$ is calculated for anomaly scores
    \end{itemize}\vfill
    Data points with $\abs Z_{score}\abs>$ Anomaly Threshold value are predicted.
