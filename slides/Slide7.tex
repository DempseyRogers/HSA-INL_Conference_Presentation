    % If $n$ points are passed to the model $n\times n$ comparisons are made, making the model \alert{computationally expensive}. Batching reduces statistics during model's first pass.%To reduce this demand, data is batched. This results in \alert{less data} to inform the model's statistics.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item A data frame of anomalous predictions is made from all batches predictions
        \item Upon completion of the initial pass non-anomalous data points are randomly selected from entire data set. 
        \item Anomalous data points from each batch are compared to each other, as well as, background points from the entire data set  
        \item A count of times each point is predicted anomalous is kept as a batch score 
    \end{itemize}
    \vfill
    Datapoints with batch score $<$ batch threshold are less likely to be false positives.
